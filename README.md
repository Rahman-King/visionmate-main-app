## 🔍 Overview
**Team Visionx** is an assistive technology application designed to provide real-time spatial awareness for the visually impaired. Built using **Streamlit** and **YOLOv8**, the app acts as a "digital eye," identifying objects in the environment and translating their position into actionable voice instructions.

This a test project moves beyond simple labeling—it calculates the proximity and orientation of objects to guide users safely around obstacles.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Smart Navigation Brain**: Logic-based pathfinding that tells users to "Move Left," "Move Right," or "Stop" based on object position.
* **Danger Prioritization**: High-risk items (knives, fire, vehicles) are announced with higher priority than static objects.
* **Triple Input Support**: Process live data via **Webcam**, or analyze pre-recorded **Images** and **Videos**.
* **Voice Feedback System**: Integrated speech synthesis with a smart cooldown to prevent overlapping audio.
* **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time confidence sliders and a user-friendly sidebar for navigation settings.

## 🧠 How It Works (The Logic)
The app divides the visual field into three distinct zones to help the user navigate:
1. **Left Zone**: (0% - 33% of frame width)
2. **Center Zone**: (33% - 66% of frame width) - *Triggers critical stop commands.*
3. **Right Zone**: (66% - 100% of frame width)



**Priority Levels:**
- **Level 1 (Danger):** Weapons, Fire, Sharp objects.
- **Level 2 (Moving):** People, Cars, Bicycles.
- **Level 3 (Static):** Chairs, Tables, Doors.
